                  <p class="card-text"> In May 2019 I started my research project with Dr. Andrej Pr≈°a of the Villanova Astrophysics and Planetary studies department. I had to learn and research many concepts in Physics and Astrophysics before I could begin to apply my programming skills to the project. I my task was to create a program that analyzed an observed binary star light curve and determine the parameters of the star system based on that. Due to the era of big data of astronomy, it is necessary to automate this, however, accurate results are hard to determine computationally. The project synthesizes a list of tens of thousands of sample curves which are then compared to the observed curve via brute force. This technique was then compared to a computationally intense artificial neural network to understand the pros and cons of each technique. I worked closely with the neural network project to help train the set efficiently. This research was then presented at the 235th American Astronomical Society conference.

                        The students would come to Villanova once a month on Saturday mornings. We encouraged them to work hard in school and go to college.
                        This was meaingful to me because the students form this school were from less fortunate and did not have a lot of
                        access to resources that would help them persue their passions. Paired with my passion for teaching and for computer
                        science, I became very enthusiastic about this program and plan on taking on a leadership role in the program this spring.</p>

                                Because of my love for skating, my friend and I founded a skateboaring club at Villanova. We are currently co-Presidents
                                of the continuously growing club.

                                I built a space-invaders mock game with python. It was my way of getting started with the language and making something fun.

                                I built a sudoku puzzle solver in js. It works with any puzzle that has one solution (any real given puzzle).

                        Click on a cover that seems interesting to read the GoodReads review of it.
                        Below, you can also see my favorite albums, click on one of them to hear it on spotify.
                        I also like to skate, below you can see the link to the skate club site where you can see clips of my friends and I.
